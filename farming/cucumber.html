    <h2>what are cucumbers?</h2>
    <p style="width:900px;">The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other
        supporting frames,
        wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby
        it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy
        over the fruits.
        The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be
        as large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter.
        Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table). In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a
        pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. However, much like tomatoes
        and squashes, it is often perceived, prepared, and eaten as a vegetable.

    <h2>how to grow cucumbers</h2>
    <p style="width:900px;"> the first thing you need to know if you wish to grow cucumbers is to keep them in a very
        bright spot, or
        somewhere there is lots of sun. They also should be in the ground because their roots are long. If you want to
        grow multipule cucumbers then you should keep them apart. When having cucumbers the soil is also important try
        to keep moist and drained. The best soil to use is a sandy loam soil, but can be grown in other soils. It is
        very improtant to keep the cucumbers hydrated because they need lots of water the soil should still be drained
        to grow. </p>
    <p style="width:900px;">the next you should know is you should have a firtelizer, compost is a excellent firtelizer
        for cucumbers.Compost
        only has 2 percent nitrogen, and it releases slowly over many years. Compost won't cause runaway vegetative
        growth at the expense of fruit. Instead, it adds nutrient reserves that stay available in the soil long term.
